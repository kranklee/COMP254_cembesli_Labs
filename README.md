# COMP254 – Lab 1
**Data Structures and Algorithms**

This project contains the solutions for **Lab 1**, which focuses on fundamental linked list data structures in Java.

##  Exercises Overview

### Exercise 1 – Doubly Linked List
- Implemented using header and trailer sentinel nodes.
- Added a method to concatenate two doubly linked lists.
- Demonstrated the result in the `Main` class.

### Exercise 2 – Singly Linked List
- Implemented basic singly linked list operations.
- Demonstrated adding and removing elements from the list.
- Output shows list changes step by step.

### Exercise 3 – Circularly Linked List
- Implemented a circularly linked list using a tail reference.
- Demonstrated cloning the list.
- Verified that modifying the original list does not affect the cloned list.

## ▶ How to Run
1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**.
2. Navigate to `Main.java`.
3. Run the `main` method to see the output for all exercises.
